### Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition System:

Developed a real-time hand gesture recognition system utilizing a with YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time hand gesture recognition. 
The system interprets dynamic hand movements into text, providing intuitive interaction with digital interfaces. Designed for diverse applications such as virtual reality environments and assistive technology for the hearing impaired.

*Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, YOLO, Pandas.*
